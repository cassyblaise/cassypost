The market cap of all cryptocurrencies is back above the $1 trillion mark according to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin and Ether have a strong price rebound in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies.

B﻿itcoin(BTC) jumped to 9.60%  which is $22,600 and Ethereum(ETH) was at 9.77% to $1,621, both gained around 9% in the late 24 hours, according to[ CoinMarketCap data](https://coinmarketcap.com/). S﻿olana, Cardano, Polygon, Avalanche, Filecoin, and Litecoin surged up to 12%

USD Coin (USDC), the second largest stablecoin by market capitalization regained its dollar peg in the early hours of Monday morning, returning to a price of 99.3 cents, USDC losing its peg to a new all time of 87 cents last Friday when its issuer Circle disclosed that it still holds about $3.3 billion of the cash reserves of USDC in the Silicon Valley Bank.

USDC fell to US$0.8774 on Saturday and its market cap slumped 15% to US$36 billion from US$43 billion. Most investors lose confidence in the USD Coin (USDC) and other stablecoins, this brings doubts and fear among some of the investors. 

A﻿ccording to  a blog post on Cirlcle its read: 

> "While USDC can be used 24/7/365 on chain, issuance, and redemption is constrained by the working hours of the U.S. banking system.
>
> USDC liquidity operations will resume as normal when banks open on Monday morning in the United States. As a practical matter, our teams are well prepared to handle the significant volume, built on the strong liquidity and reserve assets discussed below. As a regulated payment token, USDC will remain redeemable 1 for 1 with the U.S. Dollar."



The total crypto market capitalization surged by 6.47% in the past 24 hours to $1.01 trillion. The total trading volume over the last 24 hours was down 34.52% to US$60.19 billion.
