True Names the company behind the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has filed suit against domain registrar GoDaddy over the sale of a domain name it previously owned.

GoDaddy falsely announced the eth.link domain had expired, and it had been sold to a third party.

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The eth.link was registered with GoDaddy by Virgil Griffith in 2018, Griffith was working with True Names then. 

Griffin was supposed to renew the domain name around this year, but failed to do so because he was serving a 63 - month sentence for allegedly assisting North Korea.
