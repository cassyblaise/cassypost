One of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges FTX was inaccessible to some of its customers earlier today.

FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried [confirmed it](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1569676006507835395?s=20&t=QouuBExNKyfr2LnAhfS-oQ) and also apologized for what he said: "website did wonky auto-refreshing for a lot of people."

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">heh<br><br>sorry about that -- FTX didn&#39;t actually go down but the website did wonky auto-refreshing for a lot of people which was pretty frustrating, rolling out a fix for that momentarily</p>&mdash; SBF (@SBF_FTX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1569672471858536449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

According to some users who reported the issues that they can not access the FTX website:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">it literally freezes like this all the time jesus <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SBF_FTX</a> do something <a href="https://t.co/w8X6bkjX3E">pic.twitter.com/w8X6bkjX3E</a></p>&mdash; frenxbt (@frenxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/frenxbt/status/1569673067692957698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

"The resulting CPI volatility caused some users who were accessing the exchange via browser found that their webpage frequently refreshed, which made using it slower and more cumbersome," an FTX spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement. "There was no downtime as a result of the volatility and the exchange remained running the entire time."
