The collapse FTX crypto CEO Sam Bankman-Fried says he Plans to start a new business to raise funds to pay back victims of the FTX collapse.

T﻿he former FTX CEO is Still under investigation into his previous company over mismanagement of customers' funds.

S﻿peaking to BBC over the weekend from his luxury complex in the Bahamas, Sam Bankman-Fried denies fraud and that he was not nearly as competent as I thought I was.

Sam Bankman-Fried the former CEO of FTX also expressed interest in starting a new business, his major aim is to pay back the victims of the collapse of FTX customers.

> "I would give anything to be able to do that. And I'm going to try if I can," Sam Bankman-Fried responded when asked by BBC.

> “I’m going to be thinking about how we can help the world and if users haven’t gotten much back, I’m going to be thinking about what I can do for them. And I think at the very least I have a duty to FTX users to do right by them as best as I can.” SBF told BBC

The BBC also spoke to a former FTX employee who accused SBF of lying about knowledge of Alameda’s usage of funds. Bankman-Fried denied the accusation but admitted ultimate responsibility for any mishandling of funds as CEO.

> "No that's not true," Mr Bankman-Fried said, while going on to acknowledge that as CEO he was ultimately responsible for any mishandling of funds. "That's on me, one way or another," he said.

SBF was asked whether he was fraudulent or incompetent, and he replied: 

>  "I didn't knowingly commit fraud, I don't think I committed fraud, I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was."

When asked about possible jail time, SBF admitted to “ruminating at night” over it though generally appeared unfazed.

> "There's some time at night ruminating, yes, but when I get up during the day, I try and focus, be as productive as I can and ignore things that are out of my control." Said Sam Bankman-Fried
