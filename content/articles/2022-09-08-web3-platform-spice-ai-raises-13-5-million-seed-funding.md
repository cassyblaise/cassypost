Data platform developer Spice AI announced a $13.5 million seed round. It was stated on their [website: ](https://blog.spice.ai/spice-ai-has-raised-13-5m-in-seed-funding-to-help-developers-build-data-and-ai-driven-applications-2f5663be9807)

> Today we announced a seed round of $13.5 million for our platform that enables developers to build data and AI driven applications for Web3. [Madrona](https://www.madrona.com/) led the round with Australia-based [Blackbird Ventures](https://www.blackbird.vc/), [Basis Set Ventures](https://www.basisset.com/), [Alumni Ventures Blockchain Fund](https://www.av.vc/funds/blockchain), [Joe McCann](https://twitter.com/joemccann?s=21&t=IfkLpEybal18tQqyo7lRIA)’s new [Asymmetric](https://asymmetric.financial/) fund, [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/), [IEX Fund](https://exchange.iex.io/), and other strategic angel investors participating, including Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub, who we’re excited to announce is also joining the board, along with Tim Porter from Madrona. Following our Pre-Seed round last year, this brings total funding to $14.5M so we are well-capitalized to grow the team and the platform.

Spice AI was founded in 2021, To enable SQL-based trawling of data drawn from blockchains, aimed at facilitating machine learning and AI applications for developers. 

> Spice AI is building a developer first platform to create AI/ML-driven applications that harness time series data – a valuable yet difficult to harness data set for any organization. There is no ecosystem out there that is more data rich than Web3 and blockchains, but that area is currently hampered by lack of data access and infrastructure. Solving the data problem in Web3 requires deep domain knowledge and Spice AI is building the infrastructure, so developers do not have to deal with the complexity of building it themselves. Now is the time to build for Web3 and we are excited to be well capitalized to grow the team and address this gap in the market,  Sated by Luke Kim, The CEO of Spice AI.
