FTX users will not be able to withdraw or deposit any ETH or ERC-20 tokens on its platform for at least 30 minutes while the Ethereum network undergoes two important updates this month.

According to the statement on [FTX Website](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/9025415733396):

> Dear users,
>
>  
>
> [The Merge](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/24/mainnet-merge-announcement) will occur at around [ETH mainnet block height of 15,540,293](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/15540293) when Ethereum Mainnet hits the Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) value of 58750000000000000000000. The Merge will occur in two steps, Bellatrix consensus layer upgrade and Paris execution layer upgrade.

> FTX will suspend ETH and ERC-20 token deposits and withdrawals at approximately half an hour before the Bellatrix consensus layer upgrade (epoch 144896 on the Beacon Chain: September 6, 2022 at 11:34:47 UTC) and the Paris execution layer upgrade ([approximate timeline](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/15540293)). 

**Key Points**

* ETH and ERC-20 token spot trading, spot margin trading, and futures trading will not be affected. 
* After the Merge, one or more forked PoW ETH could emerge. If a canonical PoW ETH fork emerges, FTX will credit users with the forked PoW ETH at a ratio of 1:1, and borrowers of ETH will be charged forked PoW ETH based on their ETH balance as of the fork snapshot that will take place before the Paris execution layer upgrade. FTX reserves the right to update the treatment of any forked PoW ETH at any time.
* FTX will evaluate the listing of the forked PoW ETH at a later date.
* The “ETH” ticker will be used for the ETH PoS chain after the Merge.
