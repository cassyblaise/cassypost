Alameda owes Voyager approximately $200 million in an outstanding crypto loan, from a line of credit worth $377 million before the market downturn.

Voyager Digital has[ asked a federal bankruptcy court](https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175309202280000000001.pdf) in New York for an order to repay a loan it made to crypto quant trading firm Alameda Research that was largely denominated in crypto. The loans are due to be repaid by Sept. 30, the filing said.

**Key Points**

* Crypto trading firm Alameda Research will repay two large loans denominated in bitcoin and ether to Voyager. 
* The loan was initiated in September 2021. It was denominated in crypto; primarily with bitcoin, ether, and USDC
* Once the loan is repaid, Alameda will receive $160 million back in its pledged collateral.
* Alameda Ventures is a shareholder of Voyager Digital.
