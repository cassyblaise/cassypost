<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">USA Damian Williams: Earlier this evening, Bahamian authorities arrested Samuel Bankman-Fried at the request of the U.S. Government, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY. We expect to move to unseal the indictment in the morning and will have more to say at that time.</p>&mdash; US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/SDNYnews/status/1602451395910803457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A﻿ccording to reported by the New York Time, SBF arrest was the latest stunning development in one of the most dramatic falls from grace in recent corporate history. Sam Bankman-Fried was scheduled to testify in Congress on Tuesday about the collapse of FTX his fail company and SBF didn't show up. And also the criminal charges against Sam Bankman-Fried included wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.

F﻿TX was one of the world largest crypto exchange, which filed for bankruptcy on November 11, along with its brokerage arm Alameda Research and dozens of other affiliated companies.

Sam Bankman-Fried, who was the only person charged in the indictment, was taken into custody by the Bahamian authorities, the person said. He was arrested shortly after 6 p.m. at his apartment complex in the Albany resort in the Bahamas, according to a statement from the Bahamian police.
