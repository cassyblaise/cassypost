The International Criminal Police Organization(Interpol) requested law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon for alleged involvement in the collapse of his blockchain start-up and the  60 billion wipeouts of cryptocurrencies.

T﻿he Red Notice was issued on Monday according to a prosecutor working for the Seoul Southern District that is in charge of Terraform lab's investigation. The prosecutors said the notice also seeks custody of Kwon's teammate at Terraform.

S﻿outh Korea issued an arrest warrant for Kwon earlier this month on Sept. 14 for breaches of the country's Capital Market Act.  Kwon relocated from  South Korea to Singapore early this year, his current location is still unknown to many.

South Korea issued an arrest warrant for Kwon earlier this month, a move that saw many investors sell their positions in  Luna token. 

> “We are in the process of defending ourselves in multiple jurisdictions we have held ourselves to an extremely high bar of integrity, and look forward to clarifying the truth over the next few months,” Kwon said in a tweet this month.
