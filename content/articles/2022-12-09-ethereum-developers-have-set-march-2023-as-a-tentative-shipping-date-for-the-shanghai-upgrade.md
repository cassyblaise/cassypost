Eï»¿thereum Core Developers has a meeting for the year on Dec. 8, 2022, and they all agreed on focusing on Shanghai to avoid any delays, and the rollout of Shanghai upgrade will be in March 2023.

Tï»¿he Shanghai upgrade, which was formally known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal(ï»¿EIP) 4895, would allow Ethereum validators to withdraw their stake Ether from the Beacon Chain `consensus layer.

Tï»¿im Beiko created a thread on Twitter on what happens in the meeting held by Ethereum Core Developers.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And we wrapped up the call earlier today! The vast majority of the conversation was around Shanghai planning. Recommend watching the livestream to anyone interested in that side of things ðŸ“º <a href="https://t.co/xqTsKFTViY">https://t.co/xqTsKFTViY</a></p>&mdash; timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1600936500832899072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Tï»¿he developer also discussed including a set of EIPS that essentially, upgrade the Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) introducing a new EVM contract format, data separations, and new operation codes.

The all-core devs team also agreed to exclude Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF) from the Shanghai upgrade if all client development teams were not ready to test their code at the next hands-on meeting on Jan. 5, 2023. The EOF upgrade makes changes to the execution layer of the Ethereum network.
