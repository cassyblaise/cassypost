W﻿intermute, one of the leading crypto market makers and liquidity providers, has lost about 160 million in a hack.

According to Evgeny Gaevoy, the founder and CEO of Wintermute, he[ disclosed](https://twitter.com/EvgenyGaevoy/status/1572134287243350016) the details in a series of tweets that the company centralized finance (CeFi) and over-the-counter (OTC) operations are not affected, but just the decentralized finance (DeFi) that  was hacked for approximately $160 million.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Short communication on the ongoing Wintermute hack</p>&mdash; wishful cynic (@EvgenyGaevoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/EvgenyGaevoy/status/1572134271011225601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 20, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

G﻿aevoy stated that the market maker is solvent with twice over the stolen amount in the equity. It means they can repay loans to their investors without having any issues with their operations.

> “If you have a MM agreement with Wintermute, your funds are safe. There will be a disruption in our services today and potentially for next few days and will get back to normal after,” he wrote.
>
> “Out of 90 assets that has been hacked only two have been for notional over $1 million (and none more than $2.5M), so there shouldn’t be a major selloff of any sort. We will communicate with both affected teams asap.” According to Evgeny Gaevoy, the company’s founder and CEO.
